<!-- Build and deploy a React Application with Codesandbox, GitHub, and Netlify

    I’ve built and deployed several applications without downloading or editing a single line of code to my local computer, and I did it with Codesandbox, GitHub, and Netlify (learn more: https://kentcdodds.com/blog/building-production-apps-100-in-the-browser). In this lesson I’ll show you around some of these tools, and I can’t wait to see what you do with these amazing tools and your new found knowledge of React.

    CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/

    You can run tests within code sandbox

    You can create github repos from your code sandbox projects

    You can deploy your code sandbox project with Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
