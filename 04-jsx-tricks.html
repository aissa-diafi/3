  JSX is not an entirely different language, but it is a bit of an extension to the language, so knowing how you would express certain JavaScript things within the JSX syntax is important to using JSX effectively. In this lesson we’ll explore a few different things you can do with JSX, like interpolation, composition, and spreading props. And we’ll compare these syntaxes with what is generated by babel so we have a good understanding of how this translates to regular JavaScript calls into React.createElement.

  Put JavaScript expressions inside curly braces {} to have them be evaluated and their resulting value used in its current position.

  Since this is JSX and not HTML, you can use self-closing tags for divs <div {...props} />

  In JSX you can spread an object within an element, <div {...props} /> to pass properties to the React.createElement API
