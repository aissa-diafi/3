  Forms are a basic building block of the web. Every web application uses form elements as a way to accept input from the user. There are a few things to keep in mind with how forms work on the web and in this lesson weâ€™ll learn about those as well as various ways you can retrieve values from elements in the form as well as a few best practices you should consider when working with form elements on the web.

  You can learn more about basic forms in the React documentation about Uncontrolled Components.
