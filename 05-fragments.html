  In React, you can’t render two React elements side-by-side (<span>Hello</span><span>World</span>). They have to be wrapped in another element (like a <div>). This may seem like an odd limitation, but when you think about the fact that JSX is compiled to React.createElement calls, it makes sense. In this lesson we’ll take a look at that and how to side-step this limitation with React Fragments.

  Remember that React elements are JavaScript expressions. Just like how a function can't return two values, or how variables can't store two values, you can't return two React elements.

  Use React.Fragment when a specific DOM structure is required

  -----------------------------------------------------------

      --- With React.createElement()
      const helloElement = React.createElement('span', null, 'Hello')
      const worldElement = React.createElement('span', null, 'World')
      const element = React.createElement(
        React.Fragment,
        null,
        helloElement,
        ' ',
        worldElement
      )
      
      --- With JSX
      const element = <React.Fragment>    // = <>
                          <span>Hello</span> <span>World</span>
                      <React.Fragment/>   // = </>

      ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'))
