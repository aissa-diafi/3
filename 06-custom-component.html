  One of the biggest paradigm shifts that React offered to the UI ecosystem was the component model. It allows you to package up all the logic, styling, and layout of a unit of UI into a box that you can easily move around and reuse without exposing any of the implementation details of the component. You don’t have to understand how a component works internally to use it effectively. With idiomatic component architecture, rendering a component in one place won’t impact other parts of your app.

  In this lesson we’ll learn how to create a React component and how to use it. You’ll learn why things work the way they do and how to use this to your advantage.
